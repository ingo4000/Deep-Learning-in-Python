We'll come back to what that entails in more detail in a later tutorial. For now, let's recognize that these types of language models are currently (in 2022) the absolute state of the art. \n\nThe models we've seen here are not the best available models, but they do share the same basic architecture with the models that are the best—what's sets the latter apart is not only their performance on a litany of tasks, but certainly also their size: The models here were limited to under 500Mb in file size to store the weights, but the best models are several Gb and larger. \n\nAll of these models have been trained on enormous text corpora, such as the [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/), [Wikipedia (EN)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikipedia), or [WebText (EN)](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/webtext), to repressent the statistical dependancies between words, in an unsupervised way. \n\n## How?\n\nYou may wonder how, and the answer is relatively simple: by predicting words from context words. This can take various forms, but let's focus on two:\n\n1. Fill in the blank: Predict the (likelihood of) word that goes in the empty space in for example `\"the cat ___ the mouse\"` (e.g., `ate`, `killed`, `caught` are all likely, but `painted`, `sung`, `addopted` are all unlikely).\n2. Predict the next token, given the sequence of tokens so far, for each token in a piece of text. (We say token here instead of word, because a token may also be a punctuation character, or the _End Of Sequence_ token `<EOS>`. For example, in `\"the cat chased the mouse\"` the model tries to predict \n  \n  $P({\\tt the})$,\n\n  $P({\\tt cat}|{\\tt the})$,\n\n  $P({\\tt chased}|{\\tt the, cat})$,\n\n  $P({\\tt the}|{\\tt the, cat, chased})$,\n\n  $P({\\tt mouse}|{\\tt the, cat, chased, the})$, and\n\n  $P({\\tt <\\!EOS\\!>}|{\\tt the, cat, chased, the, mouse})$\n\nThe difference between the two methods isn't very large, but notice that the latter method can learn the probability for the entire sentence: From the rules of conditional probability \n\n$$P(A,B) = P(A)P(B|A),$$ and more generally, $$P(A,B,C,\\ldots) = P(A)P(B,C,\\ldots|A).$$\n\nApplying this recursively, we can compute \n\n$$P(A,B,C,\\ldots) = P(A)\\cdot P(B|A)\\cdot   P(C|A,B)\\cdot P(\\ldots|A,B,C) \\cdot \\cdots$$\n\nHence, if we took a random sentence from the text of say the internet, we can write the probability that the sentence is equal to `\"the cat chased the mouse\"` as\n\n$$P({\\tt the, cat, chased, the, mouse, <\\!EOS\\!>}) =  \nP({\\tt the})\\, \nP({\\tt cat}|{\\tt the})\\,\nP({\\tt chased}|{\\tt the, cat})\\, P({\\tt the}|{\\tt the, cat, chased})\\,\nP({\\tt mouse}|{\\tt the, cat, chased, the})\\, \nP({\\tt <\\!EOS\\!>}|{\\tt the, cat, chased, the, mouse}).$$\n\nNotice that we can do this with any sentence. Specifically, any sentence of any length in principle (in practice computational problems mount as sentences become larger). \n\nContrast this to the first method of training (the fill-in-the-blank method): This method only learns the conditional probabilities of the form \n\n$$P(X_0 | X_{p}, \\ldots, X_{-1}, X_1, \\ldots, X_q).$$\n\nHere $p$ and $q$ are integers that specify a window around the focus token $X_0$. Usually, $p \\lt 0 \\le q$, but this doesn't have to be the case. For our running example this would be, for instance,\n\n$$P(X_0 = {\\tt chased} | X_{-2}={\\tt the}, X_{-1}={\\tt cat}, X_1={\\tt the}, X_2={\\tt mouse}),$$ \n\n$$P(X_0 = {\\tt caught} | X_{-2}={\\tt the}, X_{-1}={\\tt cat}, X_1={\\tt the}, X_2={\\tt mouse}),$$ \n\n$$P(X_0 = {\\tt killed} | X_{-2}={\\tt the}, X_{-1}={\\tt cat}, X_1={\\tt the}, X_2={\\tt mouse}),$$ \n\netc.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Your Turn\n\nNow that you've seen a few uses of the 🤗 HuggingFace `transformer` library for NLP, it's your turn to try it to teach a neural network to [recognize sentences with the same meaning](https://www.kaggle.com/code/datasniffer/nlp-ex1/).\n\n\n---\n\n<small>\n    \n_For Deep Learning in Python (2022)._\n    \n</small>\n","metadata":{}}]}
